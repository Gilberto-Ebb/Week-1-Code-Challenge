# WEEK 1 CODE CHALLENGE

**Author-Gilbert**

This repository contains code for the week one code challenges in Moringa/Flatiron school introductory week on JavaScript

## Set-up instruction
---
The challenges were written in JavaScript and heavily rely on a Nodejs environment.

To get started;
1. Install nodejs and ensure to have it configured properly
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
1. Navigate to the code directory
1. To run a program, you may use 

    `./name_of_file`,
 or explicitly specify to use node by running in the terminal,
     `node ./name_of_file`
1. On prompt, the user input is gathered from the standard input, which in this case it the terminal.
1. Give an input and press enter to see the results.

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 

    A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, write a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.
